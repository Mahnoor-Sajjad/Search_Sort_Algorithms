##Program Description
This program demonstrates sorting and searching operations in C++. 
It first sorts an array of integers using Quick Sort and then allows the user to 
search for a specific value using Binary Search. The goal is to show how efficient 
algorithms improve performance when working with arrays.

##Why Quick Sort and Binary Search?

I used Quick Sort instead of Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort because it is much faster for larger datasets. Quick Sort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), while Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort take O(n²).
I used Binary Search instead of Linear Search because the array is already sorted. Binary Search works in O(log n) time, making it significantly more efficient than Linear Search’s O(n).
